# Hardware PWM
These codes utlizize the hardware in the microcontrollers to control the duty cycle of a pulse in an LED. These codes start an LED at 50% duty cycle. While each button press will increase the duty cycle all the way to 100% at which point it will loop around and begin at 0% then starting the loop over. These codes depend on the <msp430.h> library.
