# Software Debouncing
These codes are button interrupts that implement button debouncing. Mechanical switches like most things are not perfect and can sometimes "bounce". A button "bounce" is when the button interprets a single quick button input as multiple inputs which is usually undesired. The simple fix for this is to implement debouncing into codes that may encounter this problem. Debouncing allows the button to only read one input when the button is pressed. Theses codes both depend on two different libraries <msp430.h> for the MSP430G2553 and <msp432.h> for the MSP432P401R.
