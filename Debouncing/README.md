# Software Debouncing
These codes are button interrupts that implement button debouncing. Debouncing allows the button to only read one input when pressed. If it is not implemented a button can read multiple inputs potentially distrubing a code. Theses codes both depend on two different libraries <msp430.h> for the MSP430G2553 and <msp432.h> for the MSP432P401R.
